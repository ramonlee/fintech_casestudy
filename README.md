# Crypto Trading Made Easy

## About our company 3Commas

### Our goal is to make crypto trading easy with the 3Commas platform
The Founder & CEO of 3Commas Yuriy Sorokin, started to build the 3Commas platform in 2017 for their inner circle.
At that times, trading crypto directly on exchanges was challenging, because you had to constantly monitor your position in order to make any profit.
This has inspired them to build a reliable platform that can help friends within inner circle to stabilize their earnings in crypto while taking away some of the emotion
that might result in losses.
Once the power of 3Commas was realized and propel this to open further to the world of crypto outside their inner circle.

Sine launch in 2017, 3Commas has grown and developed its product extensively from listening to and implementing user feedback.

3Commas.io is thrilled to announce its successful raise of $3M in a Series A financing round led by Alameda Research.
3Commas is a leading non-custodial, Order Management System (OMS) and crypto-asset management platform
that offers a unified access point and interface with the 23 of the world's top crypto exchanges. 3Commas provides fully automated trade 
execution and portfolio management, supported by continuously evolving strategies, algorithms, and risk management solutions allowing everyone
from the most advanced of traders to those just starting to learn, share and profit.
