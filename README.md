# Crypto Trading Made Easy

## About our company 3Commas

### Our goal is to make crypto trading easy with the 3Commas platform
The Founder & CEO of 3Commas Yuriy Sorokin, started to build the 3Commas platform in 2017 for their inner circle.
At that times, trading crypto directly on exchanges was challenging, because you had to constantly monitor your position in order to make any profit.
This has inspired them to build a reliable platform that can help friends within inner circle to stabilize their earnings in crypto while taking away some of the emotion
that might result in losses.
Once the power of 3Commas was realized and propel this to open further to the world of crypto outside their inner circle.

Sine launch in 2017, 3Commas cryptocurrency management platform provides access to a number of tools designed to improve overall trading efficiency and effectiveness.
The team behind the project aim to help minimize investors' risks, and limit their exposure to losses, while also maximizing their profits.

Central to the service provided is the 3Commas trading bot which operates as a web-based service and works in conjunction with a number of devices and exchanges.
The trading bots are pieces of computer software that continuously execute trades based on pre-determined parameters set by the trader.

3Commas.io is thrilled to announce its successful raise of $3M in a Series A financing round led by Alameda Research.
3Commas is a leading non-custodial, Order Management System (OMS) and crypto-asset management platform
that offers a unified access point and interface with the 23 of the world's top crypto exchanges. 3Commas provides fully automated trade 
execution and portfolio management, supported by continuously evolving strategies, algorithms, and risk management solutions allowing everyone
from the most advanced of traders to those just starting to learn, share and profit.

### How Does 3Commas Stand Out? https://toptradereviews.com/3commas-review/
3Commas isn’t the only trading bot service available to cryptocurrency traders, but it stands out for being relatively affordable and relatively easy to use. 3Commas is fairly straightforward to get started with even for those who haven’t used trading bots in the past. There are several automated strategies that you can turn to, and the Smart Trade feature is somewhat self-explanatory. It also helps that 3Commas works with such a broad range of popular cryptocurrency exchanges.

That said, 3Commas doesn’t enable you to truly customize the trading bots unless you have a linked TradingView account. While you can use TradingView for free, most of the platform’s best features for building custom signals require a paid plan – which starts at $14.95. That can raise the cost of using 3Commas, although it’s still not overly expensive given how powerful the software is. 

### Should You Try 3Commas?
3Commas is an excellent cryptocurrency trading bot. It offers everything a newbie or experienced trader needs, except for arbitrage trading.

Even if you wish only to manage your portfolio or do automatic rebalancing, 3Commas is a great solution.

If you want to trade manually from one interface with boosted features, you can do it with 3Commas’ Smart Trade dashboard.

And finally, if you wish for a hands-off approach and fully automated trading, you can create your own bots: simple or composite. Or you can copy configurations of other people’s bots, buy signals from external vendors or completely copy trade best traders from 3Commas’ marketplace, you can do it all from this single interface.
